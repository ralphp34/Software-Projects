# Project 1a : Boggle Solver (in C)

## How to compile

To compile `spellcheck`

```
make spellcheck
```

To compile `onePlayerBoggle`

```
make onePlayerBoggle
```

## Testing using ./test.sh

Note the test file may take some time to run because of `valgrind`. If you are completing this project on replit, this may be quite, quite slow. I recommend you use smaller dictionaries and test different aspects of your program and avoid simply testing with `./teset.sh`

## Describe your work

Please provide a short description of your programming progress

In this program our computer plays a word game to find the most words in a given dice, I was to implement functions for a linked list object and a hashmap object. In these functions we made methods to initialize, delete, and all elements to these objects. We made these functions to add to our boggle program whcih runs the game. In the boggle program we wrote code to load and return the dictionary values we find.
