## Part 2: Implementation

What level simulation did you achieve

Level : 4

If you completed Level 4, describe the additional creature you added to the simulation.

The new creature that I added was a CheeseCreacture which is essentially just cheese for the mouse to eat. The cheese moves 5% of the time, and it turns 2% of the time. If a mouse is on the same gridpoint as a cheese creature it eats the cheese creature. It is displayed as an orange dot. And every 75 rounds a new cheese creature is spanned. Also if the cheese moves 15 times then the it dies.
