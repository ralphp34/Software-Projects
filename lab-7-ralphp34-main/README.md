## Enigma GUI

Provide a paragraph (or more) description of how you design and implmentted your Enigma GUI

For my Enigma GUI, I had done most of my interface in the EnigmaFrame class. There I added all the design aspects such as the inner, middle, and outter rotots. The initial position, the encrypt and decrypt buttons and space for input and output values. To do all this I used different objects of the GUI. Like I used JComboBox for picking my rotors, and JButtons for my encrypt and decrypt. From there I had created actionlistener classes for my encrypt and decrypt functions. So when the respective button was clicked the functions would take place. 


## Extensions to GUI

I extedned the GUI by adding two actionlistener classes, for my encrypt and decrypt buttons. So when the buttons were clicked they should either encrypt and decrypt. I did this by passing in all of the fields of our enigma as parameters. So I would be retrieving all the rotor numbers, the initial position and the input and used all of them from there I am using the same encrypt and decrypt methods from my Lab 5 solution. I also used my same rotor class from my Lab 5.
