## Comments

* -5 Server didn't reveive and distribute incoming connections reliably
* -5 Server doesn't follow the handshake protocol, so doesn't accept the secret, for example, and can't set a name
* -5 Server code did not reliably handle multiply connected clients (either didn't update client list or didn't reliably deliver messages)
