## Describe the OOP design of your GWack Slack Simulator

The GWack simulator uses lots of OOP. First for our buttons we implement the the ActionListener class and we manipulated the actionListener method to correspond to the button function. We also extended the Thread class multiple times whenever we would need our GUI to run multiple things at a time. For our connecter I had used a thread because I could be getting input that could be the members or the message so I need a thread to read both at the same time. Also we created a frame class that extends the JFrame class, this is to display our GUI and all of its features.
