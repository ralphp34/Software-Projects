# Part 2

Provided files with descriptions:

* `freq.c` : C file for you to complete for `freq`
* `sub.c` : C file for you to complete for `sub`
* `swift.txt` : Sample input file of Jonathan Swift's *A Modest Proposal* for testing `freq`
* `cipher.txt` : An encrypted file for you decrypt with cryptanalysis
* `key.txt` : The key for decrypting that you find (note right now, it's the no-op key that subs A-A, B-B, and so on)
* `plain.txt` : Put the plain text of `cipher.txt` in here once you crack it
* `test_cipher.txt` : A smaller, test cipher for you to work with
* `test_plain.txt` : The plain test for the `test_cipher.txt`
* `test_decrypt_key.txt` : The decryption key for `test_cipher.txt`
* `test_encrypt_key.txt` : The encryption key for the `test_cipher.txt`
