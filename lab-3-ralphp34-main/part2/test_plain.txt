... it has great practical value – you can wrap it around you for warmth
as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it
on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the
heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which
shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini
raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in
hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes
or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a
mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can’t see it, it
can’t see you – daft as a bush, but very, very ravenous); you can wave
your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry
yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.
