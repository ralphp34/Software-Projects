# Deductions
* General Deductions

* Part 1 (42.5/45)

  * -5 prob2 doesn't use a return when num <= 0; prob3 has an infinite loop if you don't use return 0 in your 2 if statements. 

* Part 2 (15/25)
  * -2.5 your row only prints once for mybad. To fix this change the inner loop variable to something that isn't i.
  * -5 Didn't do fixes.md
* Part 3 (25/30)
  * -5 You didn't print the width with the hourglass you need to show the width
