## Describe your work

In this lab I was to write two programs. Two classes we needed to create were the Rotor class and the Enigma class. First the Rotor class represents a rotor that stores char values in a specific manner. The class also has methods to get the index of a character, get the character from an index, and rotate the rotor itself. The enigma class represents an Enigma machine was used to encode messages. So in this class I had to create two methods, encrypt and decrypt for encdoing messages.

## Rotor.java

In our program design this classes data and methods are controlled by another class our Enigma class as a form of encapsulation.


## Enigma.java

In this class we are able to call methods created in our Rotor class. This happens through encapsulation, which allows us to use seperate interfaces between related classes. Only the the public interface to the class is used, the rest is hidden.
